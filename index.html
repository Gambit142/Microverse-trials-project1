              <p id="childhood">Thomas Isidore Sankara, was born on December 21, 1949 and died on October 15, 1987 (assassinated). He was born to Joseph Sankara and Marguerite Kinda in Yako, French Upper Volta, now known as Burkina-Faso. He was the third child and spent his early years in Gaoua.</p>

              <p id="military-career">
                He began his military career in 1966 at the age of 17. In 1974 he fought a war between Upper Volta (Burkina-Faso) and Mali. He became prominent after the war.

              <p id="positions">
                In 1976, he became commander of the Commando Training Center in Pô. In 1981, under Saye Zerbo's military's reign, he was appointed Minister of Information, where he differenciated from other government officials.
                After the November 7th 1982 coup, Major-Doctor Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo was brought to power and Sankara was made Prime Minister in January 1983 but was dismissed 4 months later for pushing progressive reforms. In 1983, a coup d'état organized by Blaise Compaoré made Sankara president at the age of 33. 
                Sankara's presidency was a prototype of revolutionary ideas inspired by Fidel Castro (Cuba), Che Guevara, and Ghana's military leader Jerry Rawlings.

                Sankara made reforms in: 
                <ul>
                  <li>Health care and public works</li>
                  <li>Tribunal Processes</li>
                  <li>Relationships with Mossi people</li>
                  <li>Government spendings</li>
                  <li>Women's Rights</li>
                  <li>Agriculture</li>
                </ul>

              </p>
          </p>
        <p id="death">
          In October 1997, Sankara was assassinated along with 12 other official in a coup d'état organized by his former friend Blaise Compaore who happened to be the same person who helped put him in power.
